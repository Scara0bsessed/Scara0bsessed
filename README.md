 Haii, I’m Izabel (can use Iza for short)  
 Pronouns: she/her preffered  
 straight           
  ~2010>>25.8
  
  Wanderer/Scara's girlfriend trust<3

Currently studying for exams and online most of the time.

I dont like to be alone so you can approach me or cuddle anytime! <33

I use ily/aww a lot, also jokingly flirting with my close friends..
 ❕️I kiss/cuddle people a lot so if you're not comfortable with something, better tell me directly, signs dont really help (Im dumb 💔) 

It's okay to feel shy, I just find it endearing when people sit with me, even if they don't talk<3
 If you want to vent, you're more than welcome to do so, just not too much negativity, it's not good for any of us!

I hope you won't go bald❤️

    My discord is t0tallynotiz4bel_ for those who wanna be friends!
