Online most of the time// strict Dni: Kzscr, Xiaoluc, Scaradurin, Aelumi, Collenari shippers, toxic Genshin players, Toxic Scara fans or if you sexualize him, Yall are the reason people hate him, he's one of the best written characters he doesnt deserve ts 💔

I dont like to be alone so you can approach me or cuddle anytime! <33

May be overly active or not in the mood for anything pls be patient with me --

I love when people sit with me, even if they don't talk<3
 If you want to vent, you're more than welcome to do so, just not too much negativity, it's not good for any of us!

I hope you won't go bald❤️

    My discord is t0tallynotiz4bel_ for those who wanna be friends or talk!
